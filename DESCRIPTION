Description: A stock assessment model is provided and primarily intended for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) 
  stocked in small lakes in British Columbia, Canada. From an occasional gillnet survey, age and length samples are

  MCMC sampling routines are provided, as well as reporting of assessment output.
